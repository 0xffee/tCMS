BUGFIX RELEASE 1.1.1:

Bug Fixes:
*Made responsive JS/CSS more friendly to noscript users, made logic not so shitty
*Added default favicon
*Fixed lots of time related bugs in the linklog pages (microblog.inc, mbengine.inc, mbeditor.inc)
*Made errors in linklog not cause php to die(), instead making it safely error out (so as not to mangle following dom)
*Fixed a bug that prevented editing linklog posts
*Fixed structure.css not loading on /sys/admin pages

Misc. Code Changes:
*Moved all json config files to sys/admin/config. No reason to have the main json definition in the toplevel directory for all to see.

NEW WITH VERSION 1.1:

*Design has been made more responsive, using only % and em values for width, positioning, etc. Also added a small JS file to further aid in responsiveness (the usual button show/hide stuff that JS is suited to).
*Authoring, managing blog posts can now be done via the admin page, for those dissatisfied/unfamiliar with Drag and Drop blogging.

Version 1.0 Release Notes:

*Initial release. Not much to say other than that it has all the stuff I want out of a CMS. All changes from here on out will be bugfixing and feature addition, mostly as a boon to anyone who may choose to use tCMS.
