Version 1.2 "Maxim" Release Notes:
*General mbengine.inc code cleanup, trying to play better golf while commenting more
*Made microblogger start writing posts in JSON notation. This will enable posts from here on out to have additional metadata, manipulation ability, etc.
  -Should mean less HTML knowledge required for editing your microblog postings
  -Falls back to old display/edit method if posting is not JSON so as not to crap on anything.
*Blog writer also now uses JSON notation to store data.
  -Stores poster regardless of filesystem permissions this way
  -Automatically makes a snippet in linklog pointing to blog post on day of posting
*No longer using Cortado or audioplayer.js to display audio/video, since HTML5 alternatives work well now
 -Video type postings can either be embed or the link to an actual file, if so, it'll validate filetype, etc. then display as HTML5 Video
*Responsive JS waxed, CSS used instead - will make stuff like libreJS and NoScript irrelevant

GITHUGS RELEASE 1.1.2:
*Bug fixes, code cleanup, mostly making it more friendly to the github platform

BUGFIX RELEASE 1.1.1:

Bug Fixes:
*Made responsive JS/CSS more friendly to noscript users, made logic not so shitty
*Added default favicon
*Fixed lots of time related bugs in the linklog pages (microblog.inc, mbengine.inc, mbeditor.inc)
*Made errors in linklog not cause php to die(), instead making it safely error out (so as not to mangle following dom)
*Fixed a bug that prevented editing linklog posts
*Fixed structure.css not loading on /sys/admin pages

Misc. Code Changes:
*Moved all json config files to sys/admin/config. No reason to have the main json definition in the toplevel directory for all to see.

NEW WITH VERSION 1.1:

*Design has been made more responsive, using only % and em values for width, positioning, etc. Also added a small JS file to further aid in responsiveness (the usual button show/hide stuff that JS is suited to).
*Authoring, managing blog posts can now be done via the admin page, for those dissatisfied/unfamiliar with Drag and Drop blogging.

Version 1.0 Release Notes:

*Initial release. Not much to say other than that it has all the stuff I want out of a CMS. All changes from here on out will be bugfixing and feature addition, mostly as a boon to anyone who may choose to use tCMS.
